# Automated-Chessboard
**Built:** October 2021 – November 2021

Welcome to our **Automated Chessboard**, a physical chessboard that's capable of playing out a game of chess using just vocal commands! In a few days, we hammered together an electromagnet, some stepper motors, a couple of wooden boards, and an Arduino Uno. In a nutshell, our project is Wizard’s Chess without the magic. Take a glance at the [underlying workings](https://youtu.be/oQjuFTfWiOE)!

## Features 
- Hands-free movement of 32 physical chess pieces, made possible with an electromagnet propagated by a motor-driven, two-dimensional linear motion system;
- Complex motor instruction algorithm used to navigate pieces around the chessboard (and around other pieces);
- Move checking and validation system to ensure that chess rules were being followed throughout each game; and
- Voice-recognition and speech-to-text system to parse player voice commands and announce updates to the game state.
